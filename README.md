# TA Scheduling Application

## Overview

Welcome to the TA Scheduling Application project! This project was developed as part of the CS361 course, aimed at automating the process of assigning Teaching Assistants (TAs) to courses, managing their contact information, and implementing role-based access controls. The application is designed to streamline the administration of graduate student TAs, addressing the complexities of their course assignments and information management.

## Features
